## Description

I wanted to make a page to show my artistic flair with coding, styling, and with literal art. This page is a way to view those things, as well as to get an idea of my interests.

Having an idea in mind- I was not able to fully complete what I wanted (yet), since I have limited coding experience. I learned that I still have much to learn.

## Usage

Simply open the page. The links at the top will take you to the separate sections on the page. The pictures are links and will take you to a new tab to view each picture full-size and individually. The icons on the bottom of the page will take you to a way to call me, email me, or view my Instagram.

## Credits

Here are some links to some of the art used on the site that is not my own:
